Note this uses OpenVPN and a (paid) VPN service (in this case Mullvad - recommended by 'That one guy' https://thatoneprivacysite.net/2017/10/03/mullvad-review/.
OpenVPN is used as a client to access the internet via a tunnel to the Mullvad server in your country or wherever you choose. These instructions are based on the ones on the Mullvad Site: https://www.mullvad.net/en/guides/linux-openvpn-installation/

This is different from setting up your own VPN server, which allows you to connect into your pi from the internet using the same tunneling process.

## First get the software

Download and install OpenVPN
